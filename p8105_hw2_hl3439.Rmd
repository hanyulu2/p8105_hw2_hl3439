## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset. 

```{r}
trashwheel_df = 
	read_xlsx(
		"./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
		sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
		range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
	janitor::clean_names() %>% 
	drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
	mutate(
		sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
		sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
	)
```

Read precipitation data! For 2018 and 2017. 

```{r}
precip_2018 = 
	read_excel(
		"./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
		sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
		skip = 1
	) %>% 
	janitor::clean_names() %>% 
	drop_na(month) %>% 
	mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
	relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
	read_excel(
		"./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
		sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
		skip = 1
	) %>% 
	janitor::clean_names() %>% 
	drop_na(month) %>% 
	mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
	relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

```{r}
month_df = 
	tibble(
		month = 1:12,
		month_name = month.name
	)
precip_df = 
	bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some specific kinds of trash. There are a total of `r nrow(trashwheel_df)` rows in our final dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. 

## Problem 2

```{r}
ny_subway = 
  read.csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-division, -staffing, -staff_hours, -entrance_longitude, -entrance_latitude, -entrance_location, -station_location, -corner, -east_west_street, -north_south_street, -free_crossover, -ada_notes) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)) 
  
```

This dataset contains the following variables `r names(ny_subway)`.  I retain exit_only variable as well because consequent problems might need this variable.  After importing the dataset, I clean names to make column names be of the same format and remove columns irrelevant to the problem.  Additionally, I convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable.  The dimension of the resulting data has `r nrow(ny_subway)` rows and `r ncol(ny_subway)` columns.

* There are `r nrow(distinct(ny_subway, line, station_name))` distinct stations.  

```{r}
distinct_station = 
  distinct(ny_subway, line, station_name, ada, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

* `r sum(pull(distinct_station, ada))` stations are ADA compliant.

```{r}
ny_subway =
  mutate(ny_subway, vending = recode(vending, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))

no_vending =
  filter(ny_subway, vending == TRUE)
no_vending_num = sum(pull(no_vending, vending))

allow_entrance =
  sum(pull(no_vending, entry))
```
